# Zephyr ELI5: From a Newbie to Newbies ‚Äî Part 1: Creating a Custom Board

Hey folks! üëã  
This is the first post in a series called **"Zephyr ELI5: From a Newbie to Newbies"**, where I ‚Äî someone who's learning Zephyr just like you ‚Äî share my experience. We'll go step-by-step through the process of describing a custom board in Zephyr: creating `.dts`, `Kconfig`, `board.yml`, and everything needed to make your board work with Zephyr.

We'll be using a WeAct board with the **STM32F401CEU6** chip. I'm working on **macOS** with **Zephyr v4.2.0**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è I don‚Äôt claim to be 100% correct or fully compliant with official best practices. If you're a Zephyr expert ‚Äî I'd love your feedback in the comments!

## üìÅ Project Structure

In my case, Zephyr is installed here:

```bash
/Users/kiro/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ zephyrproject/zephyr/

## Where Board Descriptions Live ‚Äî and Where to Put Yours

Let‚Äôs figure out where to place the files for your custom board inside the Zephyr project.

Start by navigating to the main directory where all board definitions live:

```bash
cd ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/boards/
```

Inside this folder, you‚Äôll find subfolders ‚Äî each one represents a **vendor** or **architecture group**. For example:

```bash
ls ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/boards/
```

You may see folders like:

```
arm/
intel/
nordic/
raspberrypi/
...
```

Since we‚Äôre using an **ARM-based STM32 chip**, we‚Äôll use the `arm/` folder as our starting point.

Navigate into the `arm` directory and create a folder for your custom board:

```bash
cd ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/boards/arm
mkdir reddit_board
cd reddit_board
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:** Placing your board directly inside `zephyr/boards/arm` is **not the best practice** for long-term or production use.  
> This mixes your custom files with Zephyr's official files, which can cause issues during upgrades or collaboration.
>
> ‚úÖ However, for **learning**, **quick prototyping**, and **experiments**, this is perfectly fine ‚Äî and will keep things simple for now.

Now that we're inside `boards/arm/reddit_board/`, we‚Äôre ready to start creating the files:
- `Kconfig.reddit_board`
- `board.yml`
- `reddit_board.dts`
- and later, `reddit_board_defconfig`
---

## Step 1: `Kconfig.reddit_board` File

```bash
touch ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/boards/arm/reddit_board/Kconfig.reddit_board
```

Contents:

```kconfig
config BOARD_REDDIT_BOARD
	select SOC_STM32F401XE
```

> You get the `SOC_STM32F401XE` name from `soc/st/stm32/stm32f4x/Kconfig.soc`  
> This is not the full chip name ‚Äî it's a generic name for STM32F401CE, STM32F401VE, STM32F401RE, etc.
> We use the Kconfig symbol SOC_STM32F401XE which enables support for this SoC family in Zephyr.

> The file should be named as Kconfig.<board_name>, so here it‚Äôs Kconfig.reddit_board.

---

## Step 2: `board.yml` File

```bash
touch ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/boards/arm/reddit_board/board.yml
```

Contents:

```yaml
board:
  name: reddit_board
  full_name: reddit_board_v1
  vendor: st
  socs:
    - name: stm32f401xe
```

- `name:` ‚Äî should match the `.dts` filename and `Kconfig`
- `full_name:` ‚Äî any human-readable name
- `socs:` ‚Äî list of SoCs used on the board (we only have one here)

---

##  Step 3: `reddit_board.dts` File

```bash
touch ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/boards/arm/reddit_board/reddit_board.dts
```

Contents:

```dts
/dts-v1/; 													// Device Tree Source version 1 ‚Äî required header for DTS files
#include <st/f4/stm32f401xe.dtsi>							// Include the SoC-specific base definitions for STM32F401xE
#include <st/f4/stm32f401c(d-e)ux-pinctrl.dtsi>				// Include pin control definitions for STM32F401C(D/E)Ux series
#include <zephyr/dt-bindings/input/input-event-codes.h>		// Include input event key codes (e.g., KEY_0)

/ {
	model = "Reddit v1 Board";								// Human-readable model name of the board
	compatible = "st,reddit_board";							// Compatible string used for matching in drivers or overlays

	chosen {
		zephyr,console = &usart1;							// Set USART1 as the system console (e.g., printk/log output)
		zephyr,shell-uart = &usart1;						// Use USART1 for shell interface (if enabled)
		zephyr,sram = &sram0;								// Define main SRAM region
		zephyr,flash = &flash0;								// Define main flash region
	};

	leds {
		compatible = "gpio-leds";							// Node for GPIO-controlled LEDs
		user_led: led {										// Define a label for the user LED
		gpios = <&gpioc 13 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;			// LED is on GPIOC pin 13, active low
			label = "User LED";								// Human-readable label for the LED
		};
	};

	gpio_keys {
		compatible = "gpio-keys";							// Node for GPIO button inputs (key events)
		user_button: button {								// Define a label for the user button
		label = "KEY";									// Human-readable label
			gpios = <&gpioa 0 (GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW | GPIO_PULL_UP)>;	// Button on GPIOA pin 0, active low with pull-up
			zephyr,code = <INPUT_KEY_0>;					// Logical input code, like KEY_0
		};
	};

	aliases {
		led0 = &user_led;									// Alias 'led0' used by Zephyr subsystems (e.g., samples)
		sw0 = &user_button;									// Alias 'sw0' used for button handling (e.g., in samples or input drivers)
	};
};

&usart1 {
	pinctrl-0 = <&usart1_tx_pa9 &usart1_rx_pa10>;			// Define the TX/RX pins for USART1: TX = PA9, RX = PA10
	pinctrl-names = "default";								// Define pinctrl configuration name (required)
	status = "okay";										// Enable this peripheral in the build
	current-speed = <115200>;								// Set UART baudrate to 115200
};

&clk_hse {
	clock-frequency = <DT_FREQ_M(25)>;  					// Use external crystal with 25 MHz frequency
	status = "okay";										// Enable HSE (High-Speed External) oscillator
};

&pll {
	div-m = <25>;											// PLL input divider
	mul-n = <200>;											// PLL multiplier
	div-p = <2>;											// PLL output divider for main system clock
	div-q = <7>;											// PLL output divider for main system clock
	clocks = <&clk_hse>;									// PLL source ( in this exaple - use external oscillator (HSE))
	status = "okay";										// Enable PLL
};

&rcc {
	clocks = <&pll>;										// Use PLL as system clock source
	clock-frequency = <DT_FREQ_M(100)>;						// Final core system clock frequency after applying PLL: 100 MHz
	ahb-prescaler = <1>;									// Division on AHB bus
	apb1-prescaler = <2>;									// Divide APB1 clock by 2 (max 50 MHz for STM32F4)
	apb2-prescaler = <1>;									// Division on APB2
};
```

> This is where STM32CubeIDE / STM32CubeMX is useful ‚Äî they make it easy to configure clocks, PLL dividers and multipliers.

> This `.dts` defines the minimum required peripherals. We'll expand on it in future posts.

> Filename format: `BOARD_NAME.dts` ‚Äî so here it‚Äôs `reddit_board.dts`

## How DTS Inheritance Works (DeviceTree Chaining)

When you include a file like this in your `reddit_board.dts`:

```dts
#include <st/f4/stm32f401xe.dtsi>
```

You're not just including that one file ‚Äî you're actually starting a **chain of includes** that bring in progressively more specific hardware definitions for your SoC.

The inheritance chain looks like this:

```
skeleton.dtsi
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ armv7-m.dtsi
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stm32f4.dtsi
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stm32f401.dtsi
                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stm32f401xe.dtsi   ‚Üê this is what we include
```

These files are located in:

```
zephyr/dts/arm/st/f4/
```

Each file in the chain adds another layer of detail:

| File               | Purpose                                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `skeleton.dtsi`    | Minimal base definitions for any device tree           |
| `armv7-m.dtsi`     | Common ARM Cortex-M nodes (CPU, NVIC, SysTick, etc.)   |
| `stm32f4.dtsi`     | Shared nodes for all STM32F4 series chips              |
| `stm32f401.dtsi`   | Definitions specific to the STM32F401 family           |
| `stm32f401xe.dtsi` | Peripheral addresses, IRQs, clocks for STM32F401xE     |

---

### üí° Why is this important?

Because it means we **don‚Äôt need to redefine everything from scratch**.  
By including `stm32f401xe.dtsi`, we inherit everything from all parent files: CPU info, interrupt controller, basic memory layout, default clock trees, etc.

This lets us focus only on what‚Äôs **specific to our board** ‚Äî like:

- LED and button GPIOs
- Pin mappings
- External peripherals (e.g. SPI flash, sensors)
- Clock source and PLL configuration

You can think of it like a class hierarchy or layered configuration.

## Step 4: `reddit_board_defconfig` File

```bash
touch ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/boards/arm/reddit_board/reddit_board_defconfig
```

Contents:

```kconfig
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

CONFIG_ARM_MPU=y
CONFIG_HW_STACK_PROTECTION=y

CONFIG_SERIAL=y
CONFIG_UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN=y
CONFIG_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=y

CONFIG_GPIO=y

CONFIG_SHELL=y
CONFIG_KERNEL_SHELL=y
CONFIG_SHELL_BACKEND_SERIAL=y
```

> This file is optional ‚Äî but highly recommended!

> It sets the default config options for your board when you build for it. Here we enable UART and the shell interface ‚Äî super useful for debugging.

---

## ‚úÖ Verify Board Configuration

Activate the Python virtual environment:

```bash
source ~/zephyrproject/.venv/bin/activate
```

Check if the board is detected:

```bash
cd ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/basic/blinky
west boards | grep reddit
# ‚Üí reddit_board
```

---

## üöÄ Build a Sample

Go to the sample project:

```bash
cd ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/basic/blinky
```

Build the project:

```bash
west build -p always -b reddit_board
```

Output file:

```bash
~/zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/basic/blinky/build/zephyr/zephyr.hex
```

Flash this `.hex` to your **STM32F401CEU6** using DFU or ST-Link.  
If everything worked, the LED will blink and a shell will be available on UART1 (PA9/PA10) @ 115200 baud.

---

## üêû Common Errors

- `defined without a type` ‚Äî check your `select SOC_...` and make sure the name is valid
- `BOARD_REDDIT_BOARD` ‚Äî must start with `BOARD_`
- Board not visible in `west boards` ‚Äî check `board.yml` and file paths
- Be careful: it's `board.yml`, **not** `board.yaml`!
